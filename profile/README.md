# Hakai Genomics

These repositories have been migrated to the [HakaiInstitute](https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/) organization.

The repositories all use the same names as before, and all activities via git should redirect automatically to the new locations.

You can update your projects to point to the new locations by updating the origins:

```bash
# Navigate to your local copy of the repository
cd path/to/your-repo

# Check the current remote URL
git remote -v

# Update the origin to the new organization
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/your-repo-name.git
```

Feel free to get a hold of @steveadams or @Mbrownshoes if you need help.
